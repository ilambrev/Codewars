# Challenge 001 Split Strings

My solution -> *[StringSplit](P001SplitStrings/StringSplit.java)*

<br/>

## **_Task condition:_**

<br/>

Complete the solution so that it splits the string into pairs of two characters. If the string contains an odd number of characters then it should replace the missing second character of the final pair with an underscore ('_').

<br/>

**_Examples_**

'abc' =>  ['ab', 'c_']

'abcdef' => ['ab', 'cd', 'ef']

# Challenge 002 Duplicate Encoder

My solution -> *[DuplicateEncoder](P002DuplicateEncoder/DuplicateEncoder.java)*

<br/>

## **_Task condition:_**

<br/>

The goal of this exercise is to convert a string to a new string where each character in the new string is "(" if that character appears only once in the original string, or ")" if that character appears more than once in the original string. Ignore capitalization when determining if a character is a duplicate.

<br/>

**_Examples_**

"din"      =>  "((("

"recede"   =>  "()()()"

"Success"  =>  ")())())"

"(( @"     =>  "))((" 

<br/>

**_Notes_**

Assertion messages may be unclear about what they display in some languages. If you read "...It Should encode XXX", the "XXX" is the expected result, not the input!
