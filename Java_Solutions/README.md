# Challenge 008 Highest Scoring Word

My solution -> *[P008HighestScoringWord](P008HighestScoringWord/Kata.java)*

## **_Task condition:_**

Given a string of words, you need to find the highest scoring word.

Each letter of a word scores points according to its position in the alphabet: ```a = 1, b = 2, c = 3``` etc.

For example, the score of ```abad``` is ```8``` ```(1 + 2 + 1 + 4)```.

You need to return the highest scoring word as a string.

If two words score the same, return the word that appears earliest in the original string.

All letters will be lowercase and all inputs will be valid.

**_Examples_**

```
Input: 'man i need a taxi up to ubud' => Output: 'taxi'

Input: 'what time are we climbing up the volcano' => Output: 'volcano'
```

# Challenge 009 Statistics For An Athletic Association

My solution -> *[P009StatisticsForAnAthleticAssociation](P009StatisticsForAnAthleticAssociation/Stat.java)*

## **_Task condition:_**

You are the "computer expert" of a local Athletic Association (C.A.A.). Many teams of runners come to compete. Each time you get a string of all race results of every team who has run. For example here is a string showing the individual results of a team of 5 runners:

```
"01|15|59, 1|47|6, 01|17|20, 1|32|34, 2|3|17"
```

Each part of the string is of the form: ```h|m|s``` where ```h```, ```m```, ```s``` (```h``` for hour, ```m``` for minutes, ```s``` for seconds) are positive or null integer (represented as strings) with one or two digits. Substrings in the input string are separated by ```, ``` or ```,```.

To compare the results of the teams you are asked for giving three statistics; ```range```, ```average``` and ```median```.

- ```Range``` : difference between the lowest and highest values. In ```[4, 6, 9, 3, 7]``` the ```lowest value``` is ```3```, and the ```highest``` is ```9```, so the range is ```9 âˆ’ 3 = 6```.

- ```Mean or Average``` : To calculate mean, add together all of the numbers and then divide the sum by the total count of numbers.

- ```Median``` : In statistics, the median is the number separating the higher half of a data sample from the lower half. The median of a finite list of numbers can be found by arranging all the observations from lowest value to highest value and picking the middle one (e.g., the median of ```[3, 3, 5, 9, 11]``` is ```5```) when there is an odd number of observations. If there is an even number of observations, then there is no single middle value; the median is then defined to be the mean of the two middle values (the median of ```[3, 5, 6, 9]``` is ```(5 + 6) / 2 = 5.5```).

Your task is to return a string giving these 3 values. For the example given above, the string result will be

```
"Range: 00|47|18 Average: 01|35|15 Median: 01|32|34"
```

of the form: ```"Range: hh|mm|ss Average: hh|mm|ss Median: hh|mm|ss"```

where ```hh```, ```mm```, ```ss``` are integers (represented by strings) with each 2 digits.

**_Examples_**

```
Input: "02|15|59, 2|47|16, 02|17|20, 2|32|34, 2|17|17, 2|22|00, 2|31|41"

Output: "Range: 00|31|17 Average: 02|26|18 Median: 02|22|00"
```

**_NOTES:_**

- if a result in seconds is ab.xy... it will be given truncated as ab.
- if the given string is "" you will return ""

# Challenge 010 Highest Scoring Word

My solution -> *[P010PlusOneArray](P010PlusOneArray/PlusOneArray.java)*

## **_Task condition:_**

Given an array of integers of any length, return an array that has ```1``` added to the value represented by the array.

If the array is invalid (empty, or contains negative integers or integers with more than 1 digit), return ```null```.

**Valid arrays**

```
[4, 3, 2, 5] would return [4, 3, 2, 6] (4325 + 1 = 4326)
[1, 2, 3, 9] would return [1, 2, 4, 0] (1239 + 1 = 1240)
[9, 9, 9, 9] would return [1, 0, 0, 0, 0] (9999 + 1 = 10000)
[0, 1, 3, 7] would return [0, 1, 3, 8] (0137 + 1 = 0138)
```

**Invalid arrays**

```
[] is invalid because it is empty
[1, -9] is invalid because -9 is not a non-negative integer
[1, 2, 33] is invalid because 33 is not a single-digit integer
```

**_Examples_**

```
Input: [2, 3, 9, 9] => Output: [2,4,0,0]

Input: [9,9] => Output: [1,0,0]

Input: [0,7] => Output: [0,8]

Input: [1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,0] => Output: [1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,1]

Input: [1,10] => Output: null
```

# Challenge 011 Matrix Addition

My solution -> *[P011MatrixAddition](P011MatrixAddition/Kata.java)*

## **_Task condition:_**

Write a function that accepts two square matrices (`N x N` two dimensional arrays), and return the sum of the two. Both matrices being passed into the function will be of size `N x N` (square), containing only integers.

How to sum two matrices:

Take each cell `[n][m]` from the first matrix, and add it with the same `[n][m]` cell from the second matrix. This will be cell `[n][m]` of the solution matrix.

**_Visualization:_**

```
|1 2 3|     |2 2 1|     |1+2 2+2 3+1|     |3 4 4|
|3 2 1|  +  |3 2 3|  =  |3+3 2+2 1+3|  =  |6 4 4|
|1 1 1|     |1 1 3|     |1+1 1+1 1+3|     |2 2 4|
```

**_Examples_**

```
matrixAddition(
  [ [1, 2, 3],
    [3, 2, 1],
    [1, 1, 1] ],
//      +
  [ [2, 2, 1],
    [3, 2, 3],
    [1, 1, 3] ] )

// returns:
  [ [3, 4, 4],
    [6, 4, 4],
    [2, 2, 4] ]

# Challenge 012 Square Matrix Multiplication

My solution -> *[P012SquareMatrixMultiplication](P012SquareMatrixMultiplication/Kata.java)*

## **_Task condition:_**

Write a function that accepts two square `(NxN)` matrices (two dimensional arrays), and returns the product of the two. Only square matrices will be given.

**_How to multiply two square matrices:_**

We are given two matrices, `A` and `B`, of size `2x2` (note: tests are not limited to 2x2). Matrix `C`, the solution, will be equal to the product of `A` and `B`. To fill in cell `[0][0]` of matrix `C`, you need to compute: `A[0][0] * B[0][0] + A[0][1] * B[1][0]`.

More general: To fill in cell `[n][m]` of matrix `C`, you need to first multiply the elements in the `n-th` row of matrix `A` by the elements in the `m-th` column of matrix `B`, then take the sum of all those products. This will give you the value for cell `[m][n]` in matrix `C`. 

**_Examples_**

```
  A         B          C
|1 2|  x  |3 2|  =  | 5 4|
|3 2|     |1 1|     |11 8|
```

**Detailed calculation:**

```
C[0][0] = A[0][0] * B[0][0] + A[0][1] * B[1][0] = 1*3 + 2*1 =  5
C[0][1] = A[0][0] * B[0][1] + A[0][1] * B[1][1] = 1*2 + 2*1 =  4
C[1][0] = A[1][0] * B[0][0] + A[1][1] * B[1][0] = 3*3 + 2*1 = 11
C[1][1] = A[1][0] * B[0][1] + A[1][1] * B[1][1] = 3*2 + 2*1 =  8
```

# Challenge 013 Word a10n (abbreviation)

My solution -> *[P013WordA10nAbbreviation](P013WordA10nAbbreviation/Abbreviator.java)*

## **_Task condition:_**

The word `i18n` is a common abbreviation of `internationalization` in the developer community, used instead of typing the whole word and trying to spell it correctly. Similarly, `a11y` is an abbreviation of `accessibility`.

Write a function that takes a string and turns any and all "words" (see below) within that string of length 4 or greater into an abbreviation, following these rules:

- A `"word"` is a sequence of alphabetical characters. By this definition, any other character like a space or hyphen (eg. `"elephant-ride"`) will split up a series of letters into two words (eg. `"elephant"` and `"ride"`).

- The abbreviated version of the word should have the first letter, then the number of removed characters, then the last letter (eg. `"elephant ride"` => `"e6t r2e"`).

**_Examples_**

```
Input: "elephant-rides are really fun!"
        ^^^^^^^^*^^^^^*^^^*^^^^^^*^^^*
words (^):   "elephant" "rides" "are" "really" "fun"
               123456     123     1     1234     1
ignore short words:               X              X

abbreviate:    "e6t"     "r3s"  "are"  "r4y"   "fun"
all non-word characters (*) remain in place
                     "-"      " "    " "    " "     "!"
Output: "e6t-r3s are r4y fun!"
```

# Challenge 014 N High Scores

My solution -> *[P014NHighScores](P014NHighScores/Solution.java)*

## **_Task condition:_**

You've been given the task of retrieving the top N high scores from players of a video game.

You need to write the method `topScores(List<PlayerRecord> records, int nTop)`, where `records` is a list of players records in the form of:

```
List<PlayerRecord> records = Arrays.asList(
    new PlayerRecord("Bob", 100),
    new PlayerRecord("Jane", 120),
    new PlayerRecord("Alice", 10),
    new PlayerRecord("Bob", 110),
    new PlayerRecord("Bob", 10)
);
```

and `nTop` is an integer.

The method should return the top `n` records, where each user name can appear at most a single time. Records should be in from highest to lowest. Users with the same score should be in alphabetical order.

if `nTop` is negative or `0`, the returned value should be an `empty list`.

if `nTop` is greater than the total number of records, you should include as many valid records as possible.

**_Examples_**

```
List<PlayerRecord> records = Arrays.asList(
    new PlayerRecord("Bob", 100),
    new PlayerRecord("Jane", 120),
    new PlayerRecord("Alice", 10),
    new PlayerRecord("Bob", 110),
    new PlayerRecord("Bob", 10)
);

Input: topScores(records, 3)

Output: [[Jane, 120], [Bob, 110], [Alice, 10]]
```
